											<h2 style="text-align: center">Streaming Is 90% What You <span class="italic">DON'T</span> See</h2>
											<p>The professionals make it look so easy. I kind of equate it to home staging: instead of the elegant vase overflowing with flowers next to freshly baked cookies on the counter, the scene is set with an expensive microphone at the forefront and a backdrop of everything personal and relevant to the streamer's particular brand. </p>
		
											<p>I'm not that kind of streamer. I don't have a microphone because, frankly, I do not have the space for one. If you don't believe me, just take a look at my setup. I've got a six-foot, executive desk I found on Facebook Marketplace last year, and there is barely room for my coffee cup. The proof of this is in the pic. Do I need everything on this desk <span class="italic">all the time?</span> Heck, yeah! Actually, probably not, but given my limited executive functioning skills, we'll just bypass this particular topic for now.</p>
		
											<p>I started my Twitch stream using Twitch Studio. It's a fairly intuitive setup and there are some nice options for streamers who want to dig deep and take advantage of the free features (I opted not to dig deep). I did a couple of streams that could best be described as lacking content, mostly adjusting settings in the Streamlabs dashboard, and otherwise visually uninteresting. Then, another streamer in my #100Devs cohort mentioned that he liked Streamlabs. I downloaded it thinking it would be easy-sneezy-lemon-peazy because that's the way he makes it look.</p> 
											
											<p>Oh Lord, for a cheapskate like yours truly who only learned how to set up a Zoom meeting six months ago, setting up Streamlabs <span class="italic">without purchasing an overlay theme</span> has been a monumental effort requiring several YouTube videos, hours of combing the internet for music that is licensed for streaming use, and the fun but exhausting task of designing scenes on Canva. That's just on the software/design side of things. Do I have a microphone? Sure do: it's integrated into my webcam. I even purchased a couple of special lights with colored filters (these were new... thanks, Amazon Lightning Deals!) to make my face a little less scary to 20-something Twitch viewers who pop in just to see what this Old Coder Chick is up to.  
											</p>
											
											<p>There are so many options for content. Since I'm new to web development world, my niche is "struggling but earnest coder"; it comes naturally, and I enjoy chatting with people who drop in. My content revolves around my current coding requirements: Codewars Katas, classwork, and portfolio design and content. It amazes me how helpful and positive the Twitch crowd is! Folx I've never met have helped me complete numerous Katas, finish bootcamp assignments, and offered much-needed feedback on my stream. One visitor even decided to join #100devs after helping me with an asignment.</p>
		
											<p>Surprisingly, all of these struggles pale in comparison to the biggest hurdle I have yet to overcome: consistency in my streaming schedule. I would really like to maintain a viewership of folx who are either not familiar with the work I'm doing and would like to learn along with me, or people who can complete my code in their sleep and enjoy sharing their expertise. I'm not looking for subscribers (I have no idea how I would handle that at tax time); I really just want to bring people together in a relaxed learning environment. In order to build this community, I need to show up on time at the same times every week. With kids, a demanding bootcamp schedule, projects, in addition to housekeeping and yardwork chores, this is a huge challenge. But I'm up to it, so tune in to see the easiest 10% of streaming at <a href="https://twitch.tv/oldcoderchick">Twitch.tv/OldCoderChick</a>!

											<h2 style="text-align: center">Learning web dev isn't just coding</h2>
											<p>When I started on this journey, I thought my days would be filled with code--surely, all of the office jobs and typing practice would come in handy! Pages and pages of cryptic letters and numbers falling out of my brain and onto the screen at 75 words per minute…	</p>
		
											<p>Turns out, most of my days are spent Googling stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with coding. In fact, nowadays, a good part of my time is spent trying to pull and push stuff to GitHub via Git, the bane of my existence. Typing speed? Turns out, my brain currently types server-side code at approximately three words per hour. </p>	
		
											<p>I literally (yes, I used that word because I am OVER THIS) have been sitting in front of my computer for three hours trying to create a remote repository in git so that I could push my local files and have something to turn in. Mind you, this is two weeks past the due date because I couldn’t get my local server to render the files because I forgot to put them in a public folder and add the all-important following code:
											</p>
											<code>app.use(express.static('public'))</code>
											<code>app.use(express.static('files'))</code>
											
											<p>I look back fondly on the days of creating text-only HTML files and agonizing over the correct semantic tags, of which there are even more than when I started coding a couple of years ago… never mind the ones that have been deprecated or replaced by CSS. Those were simpler times, harkening back to prairie days and conestoga wagon trains. Now, most of the time I feel like I’m building a car with tutorials and videos written in another language. Don’t get me wrong--the car runs, but don’t look under the hood just yet!</p>
											<p>Today, my big success is figuring out the two missing lines of code, moving files to the correct folder, and pushing the whole mess to GitHub. Not a huge win, but I’ll take it gratefully.</p>

                                    <h2 style="text-align: center">Setting up my workspace</h2>
									<p>It took two years for me to figure out that I needed a desktop with two monitors, a webcam, and speakers. Like other coding newbies, I didn't have a ton of money to spend, so I started my foray into coding by watching YouTube tutorials and coding in Notepad (yes, Notepad, not Notepad++) and in the console of the laptop I had bought when I was married.
									</p>

									<p>My relationship with coding was an on-again-off-again, turbulent affair. I became frustrated watching coding tutorials on half of the 15" screen and coding in tiny font on the other half. Sometimes, I used my kids' chromebooks to watch the videos while I coded in my laptop. I had real estate files next to coding tutorials, and everything was a jumbled mess. After a quick reality check (and disappointing glance at my bank account), I decided that I likely would not be running complex calculations, I wasn't doing much with graphics and animation, and I was starting a bootcamp in the middle of a pandemic... in other words, coffee shop coding wasn't on my radar. No sleek, flashy Apple products for this girl. What I really needed was a decent, used desktop built like a tank and as fast as a racehorse. With more apprehension than anticipation, I ordered the "brains" of my tank and hoped for the best. 
										
									<p>I'm glad that my expectations were low because my initial impression of Tank was not great. The seller had stuffed Tank into a large garbage bag, then placed that bag into another bag and filled the outer bag with spray insulation--you know, the stuff they put behind walls in houses. They boxed, labeled, and shipped that mess to yours truly. When I finally peeled of all the layers of insulation, I discovered what could best be described as the poster child of a scratch-&-dent ad.
									</p>
									<!-- insert picture of Tank -->
									
									<p>My beat-up old Tank has carried me through two (almost three--that's another story for another blog) real estate transactions as well as six months of a coding bootcamp. I have no regrets about my purchase and am proud of the fact I am doing the same work on my beat-up workstation as other people who spent three times as much on their flashy systems. Most of my peripherals came from Facebook Marketplace or Amazon's Lightning Deals. The life of a single mom is bottom-lining almost everything, focusing on functionality, value, and features--a mindset that seems to mesh well with the software engineering industry.</p>
