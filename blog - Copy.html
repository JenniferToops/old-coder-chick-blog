							<h2>Anyone Can Code!</h2>
							<p>In the movie "Ratatouille," the renowned, fictional chef Auguste Gusteau coined the phrase "Anyone Can Cook." My blog--and existence--is proof that anyone <span id="italic">of any age</span> can code.</p>
							<p>I wasn't born with a tablet in hand. I didn't even own a cell phone until I was almost 30. I remember when Nintendo 64 consoles came out. We had an Atari on which I played Frogger. My family's first PC came loaded with DOS and not much else. In spite of this--or maybe because of it?--I am fascinated by what mere pulses of electricity can do on a screen. 
							</p>
							<p>So, here I am! Learning to code and sharing the struggle of what it is like to be a single mom, well past her college years, embarking on the fun (and often frustrating) journey to becoming a software engineer and web developer.</p>

                                    <h2>Setting up my workspace</h2>
									<p>It took two years for me to figure out that I needed a desktop with two monitors, a webcam, and speakers. Like other coding newbies, I didn't have a ton of money to spend, so I started my foray into coding by watching YouTube tutorials and coding in Notepad (yes, Notepad, not Notepad++) and in the console of the laptop I had bought when I was married.
									</p>

									<p>My relationship with coding was an on-again-off-again, turbulent affair. I became frustrated watching coding tutorials on half of the 15" screen and coding in tiny font on the other half. Sometimes, I used my kids' chromebooks to watch the videos while I coded in my laptop. I had real estate files next to coding tutorials, and everything was a jumbled mess. After a quick reality check (and disappointing glance at my bank account), I decided that I likely would not be running complex calculations, I wasn't doing much with graphics and animation, and I was starting a bootcamp in the middle of a pandemic... in other words, coffee shop coding wasn't on my radar. No sleek, flashy Apple products for this girl. What I really needed was a decent, used desktop built like a tank and as fast as a racehorse. With more apprehension than anticipation, I ordered the "brains" of my tank and hoped for the best. 
										
									<p>I'm glad that my expectations were low because my initial impression of Tank was not great. The seller had stuffed Tank into a large garbage bag, then placed that bag into another bag and filled the outer bag with spray insulation--you know, the stuff they put behind walls in houses. They boxed, labeled, and shipped that mess to yours truly. When I finally peeled of all the layers of insulation, I discovered what could best be described as the poster child of a scratch-&-dent ad.
									</p>
									<!-- insert picture of Tank -->
									
									<p>My beat-up old Tank has carried me through two (almost three--that's another story for another blog) real estate transactions as well as six months of a coding bootcamp. I have no regrets about my purchase and am proud of the fact I am doing the same work on my beat-up workstation as other people who spent three times as much on their flashy systems. Most of my peripherals came from Facebook Marketplace or Amazon's Lightning Deals. The life of a single mom is bottom-lining almost everything, focusing on functionality, value, and features--a mindset that seems to mesh well with the software engineering industry.</p>

                                    <h2>Learning web dev isn't just coding</h2>
									<p>When I started on this journey, I thought my days would be filled with code--surely, all of the office jobs and typing practice would come in handy! Pages and pages of cryptic letters and numbers falling out of my brain and onto the screen at 75 words per minute‚Ä¶	</p>

									<p>Turns out, most of my days are spent Googling stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with coding. In fact, nowadays, a good part of my time is spent trying to pull and push stuff to GitHub via Git, the bane of my existence. Typing speed? Turns out, my brain currently types server-side code at approximately three words per hour. </p>										
									<p>I literally (yes, I used that word because I am OVER THIS) have been sitting in front of my computer for three hours trying to create a remote repository in git so that I could push my local files and have something to turn in. Mind you, this is two weeks past the due date because I couldn‚Äôt get my local server to render the files because I forgot to put them in a public folder and add the all-important following code:
									</p>
									<code>app.use(express.static('public'))</code>
									<code>app.use(express.static('files'))</code>
									
									<p>I look back fondly on the days of creating text-only HTML files and agonizing over the correct semantic tags, of which there are even more than when I started coding a couple of years ago‚Ä¶ never mind the ones that have been deprecated or replaced by CSS. Those were simpler times, harkening back to prairie days and conestoga wagon trains. Now, most of the time I feel like I‚Äôm building a car with tutorials and videos written in another language. Don‚Äôt get me wrong--the car runs, but don‚Äôt look under the hood just yet!</p>
									<p>Today, my big success is figuring out the two missing lines of code, moving files to the correct folder, and pushing the whole mess to GitHub. Not a huge win, but I‚Äôll take it gratefully.</p>
